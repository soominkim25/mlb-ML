# mlb-ML

In this project, I use Lahman’s Baseball Database to build and compare different machine learning models to predict the number of wins of a MLB team for a particular season, based on the team’s statistics for that season.

This repository contains the dataset (csv), codes (ipynb), and final analysis report (pdf).
